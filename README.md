# Python-Java-Translator
This is the Python to Java code translator. Remember! This translator is very easy and it won't translate difficult code.
I used ANTLR to create abstract syntax tree and to override tree nodes (Python key word to Java key words).
I added new key word to python grammar (end) because it was very difficult to recoginize where (for example) is end of loop.
